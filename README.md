I entered this course being already interested in typography and wanting to possibly see if coding was for me. Because of the knowledge that both developers get paid a lot of money and from previous courses I’ve learnt basic UI and UX on Adobe XD so if I knew how to do both I had potential to be very employable and make a lot of money in both website development and design. However I was quickly reverted into a different direction when hearing about Karen Ann and Andy’s occupation being pretty much creative coding artists. Revealing me to a creative medium I've never seen before when viewing their examples.

To reflect on this course it has been a strong challenge. Not only in the actual coding but in how creative coding as a medium was a foreign creative asset that I feel I struggled to generate good ideas that celebrated its capabilities effectively.  

I’m leaving this course with a good understanding of P5.js and a rough idea of how to actually read code and see what it's doing, which I think is more valuable than not. This does satisfy some goal I came into this class looking for. I feel I can build the bulk of a design portfolio with a template website, but I would feel confident in then adjusting the code where I can add creative elements and flare that I've learnt from this course. 

I’ve also grown a great respect for coding artists and developers. It is a brutal and tedious profession that takes a lot of patience that I think I’ve learnt I don't have. So I’m not sure how much coding I’ll do outside of university, but I do have a great deal of respect for it as a tool.

I’m excited to move forward as a creative, graphic designer and artist with the growth I’ve made in this course. It humbled me alot to find a medium where I’m creatively stuck.  So I’m excited to take this new found perspective into my own field and then also seek further creative mediums that also might make me feel the same discomfort.
